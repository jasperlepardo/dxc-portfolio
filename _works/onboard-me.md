details: The purpose of the Onboard Me project is to provide a solution that allows
  the new starter/ new company hire to complete the onboarding process by using a
  mobile app. The web component of the application is for HR resources to manage the
  starter accounts and to monitor the onboarding progress of the starter. Release
  1 is a pilot for DXC AU Melbourne, but the idea has already been shared with customers.
  There are future plans of rolling out the application to the entire DXC community
  and productizing the application.
